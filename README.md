Practicing SASS, SCSS style

All scss code is written in src/scss folder

## Environment and Settings

I used VS Code to write and Live SASS Compiler extension

Also in Live SASS comiler settings I added to output CSS
in dist folder.

```
"liveSassCompile.settings.formats": [
        {
            "format": "expanded",
            "extensionName": ".css",
            "savePath": "/dist/css"
        }
    ]
```

## run

Open index.html file in a browser.

## On your own

You can play around with scss files in src/scss folder and keep
track of how it affects.
